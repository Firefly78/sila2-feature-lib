class ErrorRecoveryServiceBase(sila.Feature, metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """
    This feature enables SiLA error handling during the execution of observable commands.
    A client can subscribe to the property "Recoverable Errors" which contains a list of recoverable errors that occurred and are not
    handled yet.

    If a recoverable error occurs during the execution of an observable command, a respective "Recoverable Error" item will be added to the
    list of the "Recoverable Errors" property. Each error item contains the error description, the command execution UUID of the observable
    command execution during which the error occurred, the time when the error occurred and a list of possible continuation options.
    To handle the error, the client sends one of the provided continuation options together with the command execution UUID, using the
    command "Execute Continuation Option".

    Within a continuation option the server can specify additional input data that has to be sent by the client in order to execute that
    continuation option, e.g. an adjusted parameter value. The structure of the required data has to be described in the "Required Input Data"
    field of the respective continuation option. The data must be contained in the "Input Data" field of the "Execute Continuation Option"
    command.
    When the server receives the continuation option the according error item will be removed from the list of the "Recoverable Errors" property.

    Instead of sending a continuation option the client alternatively can use the "Abort Error Handling" command (containing the command
    execution UUID) to stop the handling of the respective error. The server will treat this error as a 'normal' (unrecoverable) error
    using the standard error mechanism of SiLA.

    With the command "Set Error Handling Timeout" the maximum time can be specified that the server will wait for a selected continuation
    option before it stops the error handling by removing the current error from the list of the "Recoverable Errors" property and behaving
    like without executed  error handling by returning a 'normal' (unrecoverable) SiLA error.
    This can be used if an instrument must not be in a (blocked) waiting state for more than a certain time in order to keep its functionality
    alive, because some service actions have to be regularly performed.

    In case of multi client access it is recommended that only one client (preferably the one that issued the according command execution)
    handles recoverable errors, e.g. by applying the "Lock Controller" feature.
